# merican
This repo preserves the source and history of the 'MERICAN series, three KROZ/ZZT-inspired DOS games written by Mike Rimer in Turbo Pascal 7 in the '90s.

The games are called "THE 'MERICAN CITY", "THE 'MERICAN QUEST", and "THE 'MERICAN ADVENTURE". A fourth game, "THE 'MERICAN SORCERER", was in early development but never completed.

You should be able to compile the source for each game with a TP7 compiler.

To run this DOS game with a respectable level of fidelity on modern computers and OSs, you will likely need to do it via a utility like DOSBox. Playing in fullscreen mode is recommended (Alt-Enter in DOSBox). Using the default game speed and sound settings will likely work best.

Caveat: the game makes optional use of specialized routines for modulating the (ancient) on-board PC speaker. This functionality doesn't appear to work correctly in DOSBox, so enabling the "Enhanced Sound" mode is not recommended. See below for more details.

See the Adventure README for more details.
